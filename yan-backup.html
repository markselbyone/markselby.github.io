I embarrass China. I plead with fren Tong through window but he want nothing to do with me. when I turn to leave, I see Mr Rob inside with Tong and other frens, laughing and having great time.<br>>when I get home feel so lonely. Ava and I buy big expensive deano house to build life together, but now I all alone. it feel like whole life change when Mr Rob first visit, as if visit put curse on everything. I turn on TV and see Mr Selby winning match. Mr Selby also go through many bad time, he also open home to Mr Rob. perhap Mr Selby can help me. </span>

'c-can you squeeze me some l-lemon juice?' he ask quietly.<br>>I go to kitchen and squeeze lemon with all my might. I squeeze and squeeze until entire glass is full, then I hand it to Mr Selby. he gulp it down like Mr Milkin drink cider. after few minute he look much better, he say his smile and zest is restore. Selby look me straight in eye, 'just please don't say his name...' he say. I nod. Mr Selby give me business card of his therapist, he highly recommend him and say I could make appointment.<br>>after Mr Selby leave I make call to therapist. I speak to receptionist about problem, she very nice and supportive. she give me an online appointment with doctor for tomorrow evening. for first time in long time I feel good.

I roll in agony for long time. good thing Mr Rob not here to see this. </span>

Mr Ding notice my eye twitching and think I make fun of him. 'you mock Mr Ding's twitch?' his students say. I try explain no and tell them that I zested myself, but they no believe. they grab me and throw me out to the curb.<br>>I can't believe this happen. now I got no place to play and no frens. 2022 suppose to be Year Of Tiger, but this tiger wounded. I drive home so lonely and sad, foot hurt entire time. when get home, I look at clock and realise appointment with therapist very soon.

I hear them grumble behind back. as I about to sit down with food, I see Mr Hendry beckon me. Legend player want to speak to me! I go over to him and he ask me about match and season. when I explain problems, he call me soft pussy and tell me to stop complaints. he tell me to be like tiger. I think I know what he mean.<br>>when get back to table, my food gone. I look around and see Mr Shaun with enough plate for 10 people. he steal my food and feast like pig. it no matter - I am like tiger. I head to practice room and work so hard. work and work until evening. when final session begin, I play so awesome. I make many big break and lots of century. Mr Wakelin stand no chance. so happy to reach Round 2, but next I must face the lemon man: Mr Selby. </span>

Mr Rob still so close to me, his face just few inches away from mine. for months I suffer so much torment and cruelty from this man. the feeling all hurt so bad... but I stronger now. tonight, I winner - tonight, I brave tiger.<br>>I take deep breath and stare into his eyes, those awful eyes. he flinch and back away. all of sudden, he look scared. all the wrinkle on his face look the creases in Mr Murphy tummy. I step forward and brush past him. I leave room without even look back once. I no have to fear that man any more.<br>>when get home, it very late. so tired, but I feel better than have felt for long time. I can face any hardship and stand up to the evil Mr Rob. then I remember message on mirror. it say to go to attic, maybe there something I need to see up there? feeling brave like tiger, I grab flashlight and start climb ladder to attic.<br>>when I reach attic, it so dusty and dark. not been up here in long time. I turn on flashlight and look around. the place full of boxes and old junk. suddenly notice shoe prints on floor, heading to far end of attic. they look recent. I slowly follow the prints, the floorboard creak with each step. I hit my head on rafters few time, but I go on. as I get closer to end, I start to hear something. it sound like crying.
